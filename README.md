# UQpy_paper
Jupyter scripts accompanying the publication "UQpy:  A general purpose Python package and development environment for uncertainty quantification". 

The notebooks contain all the pieces of code necessary to run the various examples presented in the manuscript. The project structure follows the structure of the paper, i.e., folders and sub-folders correspond to various sections of the manuscript. Note that certain scripts require the use of third-party software Abaqus.
